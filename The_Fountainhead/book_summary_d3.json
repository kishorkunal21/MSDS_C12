That's a good  one on Guy.\" He giggled softly. \"I don't think you understood me. Do you understand this?\""}, {"name": "Heyer's end had come as everybody had expected it to come. Keating sat easily, leaning forward, his knees spread apart, one elbow resting on his knee, the  hand hanging down, swinging the letter."}, {"name": "Peter Keating won the Cosmo-Slotnick competition to design the tallest building in New York City. After winning the competition, Keating learned that his mentor Lucius Heyer had left him all his money and interest in the firm. Keating went home, told the news to his mother, left her gasping in the middle of the living room, and locked himself in his bedroom."}, {"name": "Peter Keating won the Cosmo-Slotnick competition to build a new theater in New York City. He appeared in newsreels, shaking hands with Mr. Shupe and Mr. Slotnick, and the subtitle announced what these two gentlemen thought of his building. Keating let himself be carried by the torrent."}, {"name": "Howard Roark sat at the desk in his office, waiting. The telephone had rung once, that morning, but it  had been only Peter Keating asking for an appointment. He had become dependent on that telephone in the last few weeks."}, {"name": "Howard Keating entered and stood before him, smiling. Keating sat down comfortably, took his hat off, dropped it in the middle of the desk, and  clasped one hand over each knee with a brisk little slap. \"Look, Howard, why don't you drop it?\" said Roark. \"Drop what?\" said Peter. \"The pose. Oh, the ideals!\""}, {"name": "Howard Roark and Peter Keating met at the office of a newspaper company. Roark asked Keating what he wanted to tell him about the competition. Keating replied that he had forgotten that Roark had given him some advice on the building. He also said that he would like to give Roark some of the prize money."}, {"name": "\"I don't want anyone to know that I had anything to do with that building,\" said Roark. \"Go home, Peter. You're perfectly  safe. I'll never say a word about it.

I'll break you some day, I swear I will, if it's the last thing I do!\""}, {"name": "The telephone rang late on Monday afternoon. \"Mr. Roark?\" said Weidler. \"Can you come right over?
