A hundred feet in the sky he lowered his  webbed feet, lifted his beak, and strained to hold a painful hard twisted curve  through his wings. The curve meant that he would fly slowly, and now he  slowed until the wind was a whisper in his face, until the ocean stood still  beneath him. He narrowed his eyes in fierce concentration, held his breath,  forced one ... single ... more ... inch ... of ... curve .... Then his feathers  ruffled, he stalled and fell. ',\n",

       " \"Most gulls didn't bother to learn more than the simplest facts of flight -  how to get from shore to food and back again. For most gulls, it is not flying  that matters, but eating. For this gull, through, it was not eating that mattered,  but flight. More than anything else, Jonathan Livingston Seagull loved to fly. \",\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " \"This kind of thinking, he found, is not the way to make one's self popular  with other birds. Even his parents were dismayed as Jonathan spent whole  days alone, making hundreds of low-level glides, experimenting. \",\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " \"He didn't know why, for instance, but when he flew at altitudes less than  half his wingspan above the water, he could stay in the air longer, with less  effort. His glides ended not with the usual feet-down splash into the sea, but  with a long flat wake as he touched the surface with his feet tightly  streamlined against his body. When he began sliding in to feet-up landings on  the beach, then pacing the length of his slide in the sand, his parents were  very much dismayed indeed. \",\n",

Don\\'t you forget that the reason you fly is  to eat. \" ',\n",

       " '\\n',\n",
       " \"He couldn't be careful enough on that upstroke. Ten times he tried, but all  ten times, as he passed through seventy miles per hour, he burst into a  churning mass of feathers, out of control, crashing down into the water. \",\n",

The instant he began his pullout, the instant he  changed the angle of his wings, he snapped into that same terrible  uncontrolled disaster, and at ninety miles per hour it hit him like dynamite.  Jonathan Seagull exploded in midair and smashed down into a brick-hard sea. ',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'When he came to, it was well after dark, and he floated in moonlight on the  surface of the ocean. His wings were ragged bars of lead, but the weight of  failure was even heavier on his back. He wished, feebly, that the weight could  be just enough to drag him gently down to the bottom, and end it all. ',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " \"As he sank low in the water, a strange hollow voice sounded within him.  There's no way around it. I am a seagull. I am limited by my nature. If I were  meant to learn so much about flying, I'd have a falcon's short wings, and live  on mice instead of fish. My father was right. I must forget this foolishness. I  must fly home to the Flock and be content as I am, as a poor limited seagull. \",\n",
       " '\\n',\n",

By  the time he had passed four thousand feet he had reached terminal velocity,  the wind was a solid beating wall of sound against which he could move no  faster.

      "PART ONE it was morning, and the new sun sparkled gold across the ripples of a gentle  sea.  A mile from shore a fishing boat chummed the water, and the word for  Breakfast Flock flashed through the air, till a crowd of a thousand seagulls  came to dodge and fight for bits of food. It was another busy day beginning.  But way off alone, out by himself beyond boat and shore, Jonathan  Livingston Seagull was practicing. A hundred feet in the sky he lowered his  webbed feet, lifted his beak, and strained to hold a painful hard twisted curve  through his wings. The curve meant that he would fly slowly, and now he  slowed until the wind was a whisper in his face, until the ocean stood still  beneath him. He narrowed his eyes in fierce concentration, held his breath,  forced one ... single ... more ... inch ... of ... curve .... Then his feathers  ruffled, he stalled and fell.  Seagulls, as you know, never falter, never stall. To stall in the air is for  them disgraced and it is dishonor.  But Jonathan Livingston Seagull, unashamed, stretching his wings again in  that trembling hard curve - slowing, slowing, and stalling once more - was no  ordinary bird.  Most gulls didn't bother to learn more than the simplest facts of flight -  how to get from shore to food and back again. For most gulls, it is not flying  that matters, but eating. For this gull, through, it was not eating that mattered,  but flight. More than anything else, Jonathan Livingston Seagull loved to fly.  This kind of thinking, he found, is not the way to make one's self popular  with other birds. Even his parents were dismayed as Jonathan spent whole  days alone, making hundreds of low-level glides, experimenting.  He didn't know why, for instance, but when he flew at altitudes less than  half his wingspan above the water, he could stay in the air longer, with less  effort. His glides ended not with the usual feet-down splash into the sea, but  with a long flat wake as he touched the surface with his feet tightly  streamlined against his body. When he began sliding in to feet-up landings on  the beach, then pacing the length of his slide in the sand, his parents were  very much dismayed indeed.  Why, Jon, why?” his mother asked. \"Why is it so hard to be like the rest of  the flock, Jon? Why can't you leave low flying to the pelicans, the albatross?  Why don't you eat? Jon , you're bone and feathers!\"  \"I don't mind being bone and feathers, Mum. I just want to know what I  can do in the air and what I can't, that's all I just want to know. \"  \"See here, Jonathan, \" said his father, not unkindly. \"Winter isn't far away.  Boats will be few, and the surface fish will be swimming deep. If you must  study,, then study food, and how to get it. This flying business is all very well,  but you can't eat a glide, you know. Don't you forget that the reason you fly is  to eat. \"  Jonathan nodded obediently. For the next few days he tried to be behave  like the other gulls; he really tried, screeching and fighting with the flock  around the piers and fishing boats, diving on scraps of fish and bread. But he  couldn't make it work.  It's all so pointless, he thought, deliberately dropping a hard-won anchovy  to a hungry old gull chasing him. I could be spending all this time learning to  fly. There's so much to learn!  It wasn't long before Jonathan Gull was off by himself again, far out at see,  hungry, happy, learning.  The subject was speed, and in a week's practice he learned more about  speed than the fastest gull alive.  From a thousand feet, flapping his wings as hard as he could, he pushed  over into a blazing steep dive toward the waves, and learned why seagulls  don't make blazing steep power-dives. In just six seconds he was moving  seventy miles per hour, the speed at which one's wing goes unstable on the  upstroke.  Time after time it happened. Careful as he was, working at the very peak of  his ability, he lost control at high speed.  Climb to a thousand feet. Full power straight ahead first, then push over,  flapping, to a vertical dive. Then, every time, his left wing stalled on an  upstroke, he'd roll violently left, stall his right wing recovering, and flick like  fire into a wild tumbling spin to the right.  He couldn't be careful enough on that upstroke. Ten times he tried, but all  ten times, as he passed through seventy miles per hour, he burst into a  churning mass of feathers, out of control, crashing down into the water. \n",

      "Where had he heard that? The memory of his life on Earth was falling  away. Earth had been a place where he had learned much, of course, but the  details were blurred - something about fighting for food, and being Outcast.  The dozen gulls by the shoreline came to meet him, none saying a word.  He felt only that he was welcome and that this was home. It had been a big  day for him, a day whose sunrise he no longer remembered.  He turned to land on the beach, beating his wings to stop an inch in the air,  then dropping lightly to the sand. The other gulls landed too, but not one of  them so much as flapped a feather, they swung into the wind, bright wings  outstretched, then somehow they changed the curve of their feathers until  they had stopped in the same instant their feet touched the ground. It was  beautiful control, but now Jonathan was just too tired to try it. Standing there  on the beach still without a word spoken, he was asleep.  In the days that followed, Jonathan saw that there was as much to learn  about flight in this place as there had been in the life behind him. But with a  difference. Here were gulls who thought as he thought. For each of them, the  most important thing in living was to reach out and touch perfection in that  which they most loved to do, and that was to fly. They were magnificent  birds, all of them, and they spent hour after hour every day practicing flight,  testing advanced aeronautics.  For a long time Jonathan forgot about the world that he had come from,  that place where the Flock lived with its eyes tightly shut to the joy of flight,  using its wings as means to the end of finding and fighting for food. But now  and then, just for a moment, he remembered.  He remembered it one morning when he was out with his instructor, while  they rested on the beach after a session of folded- wing snap rolls.  \"Where is everybody , Sullivan?\" He asked silently, quite at home now with  the easy telepathy that these gulls used instead of screes and gracks. \"Why  aren't there more of us here? Why, where I came from there were... \"  \"... thousands and thousands of gulls. I know. \" Sullivan shook his head.  \"The only answer I can see, Jonathan, is that you are pretty well a one-in-a-  million bird. Most of us came along ever so slowly, we went from one world  into another that was almost exactly like it, forgetting right away where we  had come from, not caring where we were headed, living for the moment. Do  you have any idea how many lives we must have gone though before we even  got the first idea that there is more to life than eating, or fighting, or power in  the Flock? A thousand lives, Jon, ten thousand! And then another hundred  lives until we began to learn that there is such a thing as perfection, and  another hundred again to get the idea that our purpose for living is to find  that perfection and show it forth. The same rule holds for us now, of course;  we choose our next world through what we learn in this one. Learn nothing,  and the next world is the same as this one, all the same limitations and lead  weights to overcome. \"  he stretched his wings and turned to face the wind. \"But you, Jon. \" he said,  \"learned so much at one time that you don 7 have to go through a thousand  lives to reach this one. \"  In moment they were airborne again, practicing. The formation point-rolls  were difficult, for through the inverted half Jonathan had to think upside  down, reversing the curve of his wing and reversing it exactly in harmony  with his instructor's.  \"Let's try it again, \" Sullivan said, over and over: \"Let's try it again. \" Then,  finally, \"Good. \" And they began practicing outside loops. \n",

      "\"I want to go back to the Flock, of course. I've barely begun with the new  group! \"  \"Very well, Fletcher. Remember what we were saying about one's body  being nothing more than thought itself . . . ?\"  Fletcher shook his head and stretched his wings and opened his eyes at the  base of the cliff, in the centre of the whole Flock assembled. There was a  great clamour of sqawks and screes from the crowd when first he moved.  \"He lives! He that was dead lives!\"  \"Touched him with a wingtip! Brought him to life! The Son of the Great  Gull!\"  \"NO! He denies it! He's a devil! DEVIL! Come to break the Flock!\"  There wre four thousand gulls in the crowd, frightened at what had  happened, and the cry DEVIL! went through them like the wind of an ocean  storm. Eyes glazed, beaks sharp, they closed in to destroy.  \"Would you feel better if we left, Fletcher?\" asked Jonathan.  \"I certainly wouldn't object too much if we did ...\"  Instantly they stood togeher a half-mile away, and the flashing breaks of  the mob closed on empty air.  \"Why is it, \" Jonathan puzzled, \"that the hardest thing in the world is to  convince a bird that he is free, and that he can prove it for himself if he'd just  spend a little time practising? Why should that be so hard?\"  Fletcher still blinked from the change of scene. \"What did you just do?  How did we get here?\"  \"You did say you wanted to be out of the mob, didn't you?\"  Yes! But how did you ...\"  \"Like everything else, Fletcher. Practice\"  By morning the Flock had forgotten its insanity, but Fletcher had not.  \"Jonathan, remember what you said a long time ago, about loving the Flock  enough to return to it and help it learn?\"  \"Yes!\"  \"I don't understand how you manage to love a mob of birds that has just  tried to kill you. \"  \"Oh, Fletch, you don't love that! You don't love hatred and evil, of course.  You have to practise and see the real gull, the good in everyone of them, and  to help them see it in themselves. That's what I mean by love. It's fun, when  you get the knack of it.  \"I remember a fierce young bird, for instance, Fletcher Lynd Seagull, his  name. Just been made Outcast, ready to fight the Flock to the death, getting a  start on building his own bitter hell out on the Far Cliffs. And here he is  today building his own heaven instead, and leading the whole Flock in that  direction. \"  Fletcher turned to his instructor, and there was a moment of fright in his  eye. \"Me leading? What do you mean, me leading? You're the instructor  here. You couldn 7 leave! \"  \"Couldn't I? Don't you think that there might be other flocks, other  Fletchers, that need an instructor more than this one, that's on its way toward  the light?\"  \"Me ? Jon, I'm just a plain seagull, and you 're .. . \"  \". . . the only Son of the Great Gull, I suppose?\" Johnathan sighed and  looked out to sea. \"You don't need me any longer.. You need to keep finding  yourself, a little more each day, that real, unlimited Fletcher Seagull, he's  your instructor. You need to understand him and to practice him. \"  A moment later Jonathan's body wavered in the air, shimmering, and began  to go transparent. \"Don't let them spread silly rumours about me, or make me  a god. O.K., Fletch? I'm a seagull, I like to fly, maybe ...”  \"JONATHAN!\"  \"Poor Fletch. Don't believe what your eyes are telling you. All they show is  limitation. Look with your understanding, find out waht you already know,  andyou;ll see the way to fly. \"  The shimmering stopped. Jonathan Seagull had vanished into empty air.  After a time, Fletcher Gull dragged himself into the sky and faced a brand-  new group of students, eager for their first lesson. \n"

      "So this is heaven, he thought, and he had to smile at himself. It was hardly  respectful to analyse heaven in the very moment that one flies up to enter it.  As he came from Earth now, above the clouds and in close formation with  the two brilliant gulls, he saw that his own body was growing as bright as  theirs. True, the same young Jonathan Seagull was there that has always lived  behind his golden eyes, but the outer form had changed.  It felt like a seagull body, but already it flew far better than his old one had  ever flown. Why, with half the effort, he though, I'll get twice the speed,  twice the performance of my best days on earth!  His feathers glowed brilliant white now, and his wings were smooth and  perfect as sheets of polished silver. He began, delightedly, to learn about  them, to press power into these new wings.  At two hundred fifty miles per hour he felt that he was nearing his level-  flight maximum speed. At two hundred seventy-three he thought that he was  flying as fast as he could fly, and he was ever so faintly disappointed. There  was a limit to how much the new body could do, and though it was much  faster than his old level-flight record, it was still a limit that would take great  effort to crack. In heaven, he though, there should be no limits.  The clouds broke apart, his escorts called, \"Happy landings, Jonathan, \"  and vanished into thin air.  He was flying over a sea, toward a jagged shoreline. A very few seagulls  were working the updraughts on the cliffs. Away off to the north, at the  horizon itself, flew a few others. New sights, new thoughts, new questions.  Why so few gulls? Heaven should be, flocked with gulls! And why am I so  tired, all at once? Gulls in heaven are never supposed to be tired, or to sleep. \n",

      "Where had he heard that? The memory of his life on Earth was falling  away. Earth had been a place where he had learned much, of course, but the  details were blurred - something about fighting for food, and being Outcast.  The dozen gulls by the shoreline came to meet him, none saying a word.  He felt only that he was welcome and that this was home. It had been a big  day for him, a day whose sunrise he no longer remembered.  He turned to land on the beach, beating his wings to stop an inch in the air,  then dropping lightly to the sand. The other gulls landed too, but not one of  them so much as flapped a feather, they swung into the wind, bright wings  outstretched, then somehow they changed the curve of their feathers until  they had stopped in the same instant their feet touched the ground. It was  beautiful control, but now Jonathan was just too tired to try it. Standing there  on the beach still without a word spoken, he was asleep.  In the days that followed, Jonathan saw that there was as much to learn  about flight in this place as there had been in the life behind him. But with a  difference. Here were gulls who thought as he thought. For each of them, the  most important thing in living was to reach out and touch perfection in that  which they most loved to do, and that was to fly. They were magnificent  birds, all of them, and they spent hour after hour every day practicing flight,  testing advanced aeronautics.  For a long time Jonathan forgot about the world that he had come from,  that place where the Flock lived with its eyes tightly shut to the joy of flight,  using its wings as means to the end of finding and fighting for food. But now  and then, just for a moment, he remembered.  He remembered it one morning when he was out with his instructor, while  they rested on the beach after a session of folded- wing snap rolls.  \"Where is everybody , Sullivan?\" He asked silently, quite at home now with  the easy telepathy that these gulls used instead of screes and gracks. \"Why  aren't there more of us here? Why, where I came from there were... \"  \"... thousands and thousands of gulls. I know. \" Sullivan shook his head.  \"The only answer I can see, Jonathan, is that you are pretty well a one-in-a-  million bird. Most of us came along ever so slowly, we went from one world  into another that was almost exactly like it, forgetting right away where we  had come from, not caring where we were headed, living for the moment. Do  you have any idea how many lives we must have gone though before we even  got the first idea that there is more to life than eating, or fighting, or power in  the Flock? A thousand lives, Jon, ten thousand! And then another hundred  lives until we began to learn that there is such a thing as perfection, and  another hundred again to get the idea that our purpose for living is to find  that perfection and show it forth. The same rule holds for us now, of course;  we choose our next world through what we learn in this one. Learn nothing,  and the next world is the same as this one, all the same limitations and lead  weights to overcome. \"  he stretched his wings and turned to face the wind. \"But you, Jon. \" he said,  \"learned so much at one time that you don 7 have to go through a thousand  lives to reach this one. \"  In moment they were airborne again, practicing. The formation point-rolls  were difficult, for through the inverted half Jonathan had to think upside  down, reversing the curve of his wing and reversing it exactly in harmony  with his instructor's.  \"Let's try it again, \" Sullivan said, over and over: \"Let's try it again. \" Then,  finally, \"Good. \" And they began practicing outside loops. \n",

      "One evening the gulls that were not nightly-flying stood together on the  sand, thinking. Jonathon took all his courage in his head and walked to the  Elder Gull, who, it was said, was soon to be moving beyond this world.  \"Chiang... \" he said, a little nervously.  The old seagull looked at him kindly. \"Yes,, my son?\" Instead of being  enfeebled by age, the Elder had been empowered by it; he could outfly any  gull in the Flock, and he had learned skills that the others were only gradually  coming to know.  \"Chiang, this world isn't heaven at all, is it?\"  The Elder smiled in the moonlight. \"You are learning again, Jonathan  Seagull, \" he said.  Well, what happens from here? Where are we going? Is there no such  place as heaven?\"  \"No, Jonathan, there is no such place. Heaven is not a place, and it is not a  time. Heaven is being perfect. \" He was silent for a moment. \"You are a very  fast flier, aren 't you ? \" \n",
      "summary ->> \"This world isn't heaven at all, is it?\" \"No, Jonathan, there is no such place. Heaven is being perfect\" \"You are a very  fast flier, aren 't you?\"\n",

Because any number is a limit, and perfection  doesn't have limits. Perfect speed, my son, is being there. \"  Without warning, Chiang vanished and appeared at the waters edge fifty  feet away, all in the flicker of an instant. Then he vanished again and stood,  in the same millisecond, at Jonathan's shoulder. \"It's kind of fun, \" he said.  Jonathan was dazzled. He forgot to ask about heaven. \"How do you do  that? What does it feel like? How far can you go?\"  \"You can go to any place and to any time that you wish to go, \" the Elder  said. \"I've gone everywhere and everywhen I can think of. \" He looked across  the sea. \"It's strange. The gulls who scorn perfection for the sake of travel go  nowhere, slowly. Those who put aside travel for the sake of perfection go  anywhere, instantly.

Heaven is... \"  \"Can you teach me to fly like that?\" Jonathan Seagull trembled to conquer  another unknown.  \"Of course, if you wish to learn.\"  \"I wish. When can we start?”  \"We could start now, if you'd like. \"  \"I want to learn to fly like that, \" Jonathan said, and a strange light glowed  in his eyes. \"Tell me what to do. \"  Chiang spoke slowly and watched the younger gull ever so carefully. \"To  fly as fast as thought, to anywhere that is, \" he said, \"you must begin by  knowing that you have already arrived... \"  The trick, according to Chiang, was for Jonathan to stop seeing himself as  trapped inside a limited body that had a forty-two-inch wingspan and  performance that could be plotted on a chart. The trick was to know that his  true nature lived, as perfect as an unwritten number, everywhere at once  across space and time. \n",

Jonathan opened his eyes. He stood alone with the Elder on a totally  different seashore - trees down to the water's edge, twin yellow suns turning  overhead.  \"At last you've got the idea, \" Chiang said, \"but your control needs a little  work... \"  Jonathan was stunned. \"Where are we?\"  Utterly unimpressed with the strange surroundings, the Elder brushed the  question aside. \"We're on some planet, obviously, with a green sky and a  double star for a sun. \"  Jonathan made a scree of delight, the first sound he had made since he had  left Earth. \"IT WORKS! \"  \"Well, of course it works, Jon. \" said Chaing. \"It always works, when you  know what you're doing. Now about your control... \" \n",

      "By the time they returned, it was dark. The other gulls looked at Jonathan  with awe in their golden eyes, for they have seen him disappear from where  he had been rooted for so long.  He stood their congratulations for less than a minute, \"I'm the newcomer  here! I'm just beginning! It is I who must learn from you!\"  \"I wonder about that, Jon, \" said Sullivan, standing near. \"You have less  fear of learning than any gull I've seen in the thousand years. \" The Flock fell  silent, and Jonathan fidgeted in embarrassment.  \"We can start working with time if you wish, \" Chiang said, \"till you canffly  the past and the future. And then you will be ready to begin the most difficult,  the most pwerful, the most fun of all. You will be ready to begin to fly up and  know the meaning of kindness and of love. \n",

      "A month went by, or something that felt about like a month, and Jonathan  learned at the tremendous rate. He always had learned quickly from ordinary  experience, and now, the special student of the Elder Himself, he took in new  ideas like a streamlined feathered computer.  But then the day came that Chiang vanished. He had been talking quietly  with them all, exhorting them never to stop their learning and their practising  and their striving to understand more of the perfect invisible priciple of all  life. Then, as he spoke, his feathers went brighter and brighter and at last  turned so brilliant that no gull could look upon him.  \"Jonathan, \" he said, and these were the last words that he spoke, \"keep  working on love. \"  When they could see again, Chiang was gone.  As the days went past, Jonathan found himself thinking time and time  again of the Earth from which he had come. If he had known there just a  tenth, just a hundredth, of what he knew here, how much more life would  have meant! He stood on the sand and fell to wondering if there was a gull  back there who might be struggling to break out of his limits, to see the  meaning of flight beyond a way of travel to get a breadcrumb from a rowboat.  Perhaps there might even have been one made Outcast for speaking his truth  in the face of the Flock. And the more Jonathan practised his kindness  lessons, and the more he worked to know the nature of love, the more he  wanted to go back to Earth. For in spite of his lonely past, Jonathan Seagull  was born to be an instructor, and his own way of demonstrating love was to  give something of the truth that he had seen to a gull who asked only a  chance to see truth for himself.  Sullivan, adept now at thought-speed flight and helping the others to learn,  was doubtful.  \"Jon, you were Outcast once. Why do you think that any of the gulls in  your old time would listen to you now? You know the proverb, and it's true:  The gull sees farthest who flies highest. Those gulls where you came from are  standing on the ground, squaking and fighting among themselves. They're a  thousand miles from heaven - and you say you want to show them heaven  from where they stand! Jon, they can't see their own wingtips! Stay here.  Help the new gulls here, the ones who are high enough to see what you have  to tell them. \" He was quiet for a moment, and then he said, \"What if Chiang  had gone back to his old worlds? Where would you have been today?\"  The last point was the telling one, and Sullivan was right. The gull ses  farthest who flies highest. \n",

      "Jonathan stayed and worked with the new birds coming in, who were all  very bright and quick with their lessons, but the old eeling cam back, and he  couldn't help but think that there might be one or two gulls back on Earth  who would be able to learn, too. How much more would he have known by  now if Chaing had come to him on the day that he was Outcast!  \"Sully, I must go back, \" he said at last. \"Your students are doing well. They  can help you bring the newcomers along. \"  Sullivan sighed, but he did not argue. \"I think I'll miss you, Jonathan, \" was  all that he said.  \"Sully, for shame!\" Jonathan said in reproach, \"and don't be foolish! What  are we trying to practise every day? If our friendship depends on things like  space and time, then when we finally overcome space and time, we've  destroyed our own brotherhood! But overcome space, and all we have left is  Here. Overcome time, and all we have left is Now. And in the middle of Here  and Now, don't you think that we might see each other once or twice?\"  Sullivan Seagull laughed in spite of himself. \"You crazy bird, \" he said  kindly. \"If anybody can show someone on the ground how to see a thousand  miles, it will be Jonathan Livingston Seagull.: He looked at the sand. \"Good-  bye, Jon, my friend. \"  \"Good-bye, Sully. We'll meet again. \" And with that, Jonathan held in  thought an image of the great gull-flocks on the shore of another time, and he  knew with practiced ease that he was not bone and feather but a perfect idea  of freedom and fight, limited by nothing at all.  Fletcher Lynd Seagull was still quite young, but already he knew that no  bird had ever been so harshly treated by any Flock, or with so much injustice.  \"I don 't care what they say, \" he thought fiercely , and his vision blured as  he flew out toward the Far Cliffs. \"There's so much more to flying than just  flapping around from place to place! A a....mnosquito does that! One little  barrel-roll around the Elder Gull, just for fun, and I'm Outcast! Are they  blind? Can 't they see? Can 't they think of the glory that it'll be when we really  learn to fly?  \"I don't care what they think. I'll show them what flying is! I'll be pure  Outlaw, if that's the way they want it. And I'll make them so sorry... \"  The voice came inside his own head, and though it was very gentle, it  startled him so much that he faltered and stumbled in the air. \n",

Forgive them, and help them to understand. \"  An inch from his right wingtip flew the most brilliant white gull in all the  world, gliding effortlessly along, not moving a feather, at what was very  nearly Fletcher's top speed.  There was a moment of chaos in the young bird.  \"What's going on? Am I mad? Am I dead? What is this?\"  Low and calm, the voice went on within his thought, demanding an  answer. \"Fletcher Lynd Seagull, do you want to fly?\"  \"YES, I WANT TO FLY!\"  \"Fletcher Lynd Seagull, do you want to fly so much that you will forgive  the Flock, and learn, and go back to them one day and work to help them  know?\"  There was no lying to this magnificent skilful being, no matter how proud  or how hurt a bird was Fletcher Seagull.  \"I do, \" he said softly.  \"Then, Fletch, \" that bright creature said to him, and the voice was very  kind, \"Let's begin with Level Flight... \" \n",

       "'{\"PART ONE\": [[\"Jonathan Livingston Seagull - a story \", \"summarize:Jonathan Livingston Seagull - a story  about a seagull. Jonathan Livingston Segull -  a story about a man who lost his life in a bird crash.\"], [\"PART ONE it was morning, and the new sun sparkled gold across the ripples of a gentle  sea.  A mile from shore a fishing boat chummed the water, and the word for  Breakfast Flock flashed through the air, till a crowd of a thousand seagulls  came to dodge and fight for bits of food. It was another busy day beginning.  But way off alone, out by himself beyond boat and shore, Jonathan  Livingston Seagull was practicing. A hundred feet in the sky he lowered his  webbed feet, lifted his beak, and strained to hold a painful hard twisted curve  through his wings. The curve meant that he would fly slowly, and now he  slowed until the wind was a whisper in his face, until the ocean stood still  beneath him. He narrowed his eyes in fierce concentration, held his breath,  forced one ... single ... more ... inch ... of ... curve .... Then his feathers  ruffled, he stalled and fell.  Seagulls, as you know, never falter, never stall. To stall in the air is for  them disgraced and it is dishonor.  But Jonathan Livingston Seagull, unashamed, stretching his wings again in  that trembling hard curve - slowing, slowing, and stalling once more - was no  ordinary bird.  Most gulls didn\\'t bother to learn more than the simplest facts of flight -  how to get from shore to food and back again. For most gulls, it is not flying  that matters, but eating. For this gull, through, it was not eating that mattered,  but flight. More than anything else, Jonathan Livingston Seagull loved to fly.  This kind of thinking, he found, is not the way to make one\\'s self popular  with other birds. Even his parents were dismayed as Jonathan spent whole  days alone, making hundreds of low-level glides, experimenting.  He didn\\'t know why, for instance, but when he flew at altitudes less than  half his wingspan above the water, he could stay in the air longer, with less  effort. His glides ended not with the usual feet-down splash into the sea, but  with a long flat wake as he touched the surface with his feet tightly  streamlined against his body. When he began sliding in to feet-up landings on  the beach, then pacing the length of his slide in the sand, his parents were  very much dismayed indeed.  Why, Jon, why?\\\\u201d his mother asked. \\\\\"Why is it so hard to be like the rest of  the flock, Jon? Why can\\'t you leave low flying to the pelicans, the albatross?  Why don\\'t you eat? Jon , you\\'re bone and feathers!\\\\\"  \\\\\"I don\\'t mind being bone and feathers, Mum. I just want to know what I  can do in the air and what I can\\'t, that\\'s all I just want to know. \\\\\"  \\\\\"See here, Jonathan, \\\\\" said his father, not unkindly. \\\\\"Winter isn\\'t far away.  Boats will be few, and the surface fish will be swimming deep. If you must  study,, then study food, and how to get it. This flying business is all very well,  but you can\\'t eat a glide, you know. Don\\'t you forget that the reason you fly is  to eat. \\\\\"  Jonathan nodded obediently. For the next few days he tried to be behave  like the other gulls; he really tried, screeching and fighting with the flock  around the piers and fishing boats, diving on scraps of fish and bread. But he  couldn\\'t make it work.  It\\'s all so pointless, he thought, deliberately dropping a hard-won anchovy  to a hungry old gull chasing him. I could be spending all this time learning to  fly. There\\'s so much to learn!  It wasn\\'t long before Jonathan Gull was off by himself again, far out at see,  hungry, happy, learning.  The subject was speed, and in a week\\'s practice he learned more about  speed than the fastest gull alive.  From a thousand feet, flapping his wings as hard as he could, he pushed  over into a blazing steep dive toward the waves, and learned why seagulls  don\\'t make blazing steep power-dives. In just six seconds he was moving  seventy miles per hour, the speed at which one\\'s wing goes unstable on the  upstroke.  Time after time it happened. Careful as he was, working at the very peak of  his ability, he lost control at high speed.  Climb to a thousand feet. Full power straight ahead first, then push over,  flapping, to a vertical dive. Then, every time, his left wing stalled on an  upstroke, he\\'d roll violently left, stall his right wing recovering, and flick like  fire into a wild tumbling spin to the right.  He couldn\\'t be careful enough on that upstroke. Ten times he tried, but all  ten times, as he passed through seventy miles per hour, he burst into a  churning mass of feathers, out of control, crashing down into the water. \", \"Jonathan Livingston Seagull was a seagull who loved to fly. He spent whole days alone, making hundreds of low-level glides, experimenting. For this gull, through, it was not eating that mattered, but flight.\"], [\"They key, he thought as last, dripping wet, must be to hold the wings still  at high speeds - to flap up to fifty and then hold the wings still. \", \"They key, he thought as last, dripping wet, must be to hold the wings still at high speeds - to flap up to fifty and then hold the Wings still.\"], [\"From two thousand feet he tried again, rolling into his dive, beak straight  down, wings full out and stable from the moment he passed fifty miles per  hour. It took tremendous strength, but it worked. In ten seconds he has  blurred through ninety miles per hour. Jonathan had set a world speed record  for seagulls !  But victory was short-lived. The instant he began his pullout, the instant he  changed the angle of his wings, he snapped into that same terrible  uncontrolled disaster, and at ninety miles per hour it hit him like dynamite.  Jonathan Seagull exploded in midair and smashed down into a brick-hard sea.  When he came to, it was well after dark, and he floated in moonlight on the  surface of the ocean. His wings were ragged bars of lead, but the weight of  failure was even heavier on his back. He wished, feebly, that the weight could  be just enough to drag him gently down to the bottom, and end it all.  As he sank low in the water, a strange hollow voice sounded within him.  There\\'s no way around it. I am a seagull. I am limited by my nature. If I were  meant to learn so much about flying, I\\'d have a falcon\\'s short wings, and live  on mice instead of fish. My father was right. I must forget this foolishness. I  must fly home to the Flock and be content as I am, as a poor limited seagull.  The voice faded, and Jonathan agreed. The place for a seagull at night is on  shore, and from this moment forth, he vowed, he would be a normal gull. It  would make everyone happier.  He pushed wearily away from the dark water and flew toward the land,  grateful for what he had learned about work-saving low-altitude flying.  But no, he thought. I am done with the way I was, I am done with  everything I learned. I am a seagull like every other seagull, and I will fly like  one. So he climbed painfully to a hundred feet and flapped his wings harder,  pressing for shore.  He felt better for his decision to be just another one of the flock, there  would be no ties now to the force that had driven him to learn, there would be  no more challenge and no more failure. And it was pretty, just to stop  thinking, and fly through the dark, toward the lights above the beach.  Dark! The hollow voice cracked in alarm. Seagulls never fly in the dark!  Jonathan was not alert to listen. It\\'s pretty, he thought. The moon and the  lights twinkling on the water, throwing out little beacon-trails though the  night, and all so peaceful and still... \", \"Jonathan Seagull is a seagull who learned to fly by accident. He crashed into the sea at a speed of ninety miles per hour. He vowed to become a normal gull and return to his flock.\"], [\"Get Down! Seagulls never fly in the dark! If you were meant to fly in the  dark, you\\'d have the eyes f an owl! You\\'d have charts for brains! You\\'d have  a falcon\\'s short wings!  There in the night, a hundred feet in the air, Jonathan Livingston Seagull -  blinked. His pain, his resolutions, vanished.  Short Wings. A falcon\\'s short wings!  That\\'s the answer! What a fool I\\'ve been! All I need is a tiny little wing, all  I need is to fold most of my wings and fly on just the tips alone! Short wings !  He climbed two thousand feet above the black sea, and without a moment  for thought of failure and death, he brought his forewings tightly in to his  body, left only the narrow swept daggers of his wingtips extended into the  wind, and fell into a vertical dive.  The wind was a monster roar at his head. Seventy miles per hour, ninety, a  hundred and twenty and faster still. The wing-strain now at a hundred and  forty miles per hour wasn\\'t nearly as hard as it had been before at seventy,  and with the faintest twist of his wingtips he eased out of the dive and shot  above the waves, a grey cannonball under the moon.  He closed his eyes to slits against the wind and rejoiced. A hundred forty  miles per hour! and under control! If I dive from five thousand feet instead of  two thousand, I wonder how fast...  His vows of a moment before were forgotten, swept away in that great  swift wind. Yet he felt guiltless, breaking the promises he had made himself.  Such promises are only for the gulls that accept the ordinary. One who has  touched excellence in his learning has no need of that kind of promise.  By sunup, Jonathan Gull was practicing again. From five thousand feet the  fishing boats were specks in the flat blue water. Breakfast Flock was a faint  cloud of dust motes, circling.  He was alive, trembling ever so slightly with delight, proud that his fear  was under control. Then without ceremony he hugged in his forewings,  extended his short, angled wingtips, and plunged directly toward the sea. By  the time he had passed four thousand feet he had reached terminal velocity,  the wind was a solid beating wall of sound against which he could move no  faster. He was flying now straight down, at two hundred fourteen miles per  hour. He swallowed, knowing that if his wings unfolded at that speed he\\'d be  blown into a million tiny shreds of seagull. But the speed was power, and the  speed was joy, and the speed was pure beauty. \", \"Jonathan Livingston Seagull is a seagull who learned to fly in the dark. He learned how to fly on just the tips of his wings. He now flies at a hundred and forty miles per hour.\"], [\"He began his pullout at a thousand feet, wingtips thudding and blurring in  that gigantic wind, the boat and the crowd of gulls tilting and growing  meteor-fast, directly in his path.  He couldn\\'t stop; he didn\\'t know yet even how to turn at that speed.  Collision would be instant death.  And so he shut his eyes.  It happened that morning, then, just after sunrise, that Jonathan Livingston  Seagull fired directly through the centre of Breakfast Flock, ticking off two  hundred twelve miles per hour, eyes closed, in a great roaring shriek of wind  and feathers. The Gull of Fortune smiled upon him this once, and no one was  killed.  By the time he had pulled his beak straight up into the sky he was still  scorching along at a hundred and sixty miles per hour. When he had slowed  to twenty and stretched his wings again at last, the boat was a crumb on the  sea, four thousand feet below.  His thought was triumph. Terminal velocity! A seagull two hundred  fourteen miles per hour! It was a breakthrough, the greatest single moment in  the history of the Flock, and in that moment a new age opened for Jonathan  Gull. Flying out to his lonely practice area, folding his wings for a dive from  eight thousand feet, he set himself at once to discover how to turn.  A single wingtip feather, he found, moved a fraction of an inch, gives a  smooth sweeping curve at the tremendous speed. Before he learned this,  however, he found that moving more than one feather at that speed will spin  you like a rifle ball ... and Jonathan had flown the first aerobatics of any  seagull on earth.  He spared no time that day for talk with other gulls, but flew on past  sunset. He discovered the loop, the slow roll, the point roll, the inverted spin,  the gull bunt, the pinwheel. \", \"Jonathan Livingston  Seagull flew directly through the centre of Breakfast Flock, ticking off two  hundred twelve miles per hour, eyes closed, in a great roaring shriek of wind and feathers. The Gull of Fortune smiled upon him this once, and no one was killed.\"], [\"When Jonathan Seagull joined the Flock on the beach, it was full night. He  was dizzy and terribly tired. Yet in delight he flew a loop to landing, with a  snap roll just before touchdown. When they hear of it, he thought, of the  Breakthrough, they\\'ll be wild with joy. How much more there is now to  living! Instead of our drab slogging forth and back to the fishing boats, there\\'s  a reason to life! We can list ourselves out of ignorance, we can find ourselves  as creatures of excellence and intelligence and skill. We can be free! We can  learn to fly! \", \"When Jonathan Seagull joined the Flock on the beach, it was full night. He was dizzy and terribly tired. Yet in delight he flew a loop to landing, with a  snap roll just before touchdown.\"], [\"The years head hummed and glowed with promise.  The gulls were flocked into the Council Gathering when he landed, and  apparently had been so flocked for sometime. They were, in fact, waiting.  \\\\\"Jonathan Livingston Seagull! Stand to Centre!\\\\\" The Elder\\'s words  sounded in a voice of highest ceremony. Stand to Centre meant only great  shame or great honor. Stand to Centre for honor was the way the gulls\\'  foremost leaders were marked. Of course, he thought, the Breakfast Flock  this morning; they saw the Breakthrough! But I want no honors. I have no  wish to be leader. I want only to share what I\\'ve found, to show those  horizons out ahead for us all. He stepped forward.  \\\\\"Jonathan Livingston Seagull , \\\\\" said the Elder, \\\\\"Stand to Centre for shame  in the sight of your fellow gulls!\\\\\"  It felt like being hit with a board. His knees went weak, his feathers  sagged, there was a roaring in his ears. Centred for shame? Impossible! The  Breakthrough! They can\\'t understand! They\\'re wrong, they\\'re wrong!  \\\\\"...for his reckless irresponsibly, \\\\\" the solemn voice intoned, \\\\\"violating the  dignity and tradition of the Gull Family... \\\\\"  To be centred for shame meant that he would be cast out of gull society,  banished to the solitary life on the Far Cliffs.  \\\\\"...one day, Jonathan Livingston Seagull, you shall learn that  irresponsibly? My brothers!\\\\\" he cried. \\\\\"Who is more responsible than a gull  who finds and follows a meaning, a higher purpose for life? For a thousand  years we have scrabbled after fish heads, but now we have a chance, let me  show you what I\\'ve found... \\\\\"  The Flock might as well have been stone.  \\\\\"The Brotherhood is broken, \\\\\" the gulls intoned together, and with one  accord they solemnly closed their ears and turned their backs upon him. \", \"Jonathan Livingston Seagull found a new purpose for life. He stood to Centre for shame in the sight of his fellow gulls. To be centred for shame meant he would be cast out of gull society.\"], [\"Jonathan Seagull spent the rest of his days alone, but he flew way out  beyond the Far Cliffs. His one sorrow was not solitude, it was that other gulls  refused to believe the glory of flight that awaited them; they refused to open  their eyes and see.  He learned more each day. He learned that a streamlined high-speed dive  could bring him to find the rare and tasty fish that schooled ten feet below the  surface of the ocean: he no longer needed fishing boats and stale bread for  survival. He learned to sleep in the air, setting a course at night across the  offshore wind, covering a hundred miles from sunset to sunrise. With the  same inner control, he flew through heavy sea-fogs and climbed above them  into dazzling clear skies... in the very times when every other gull stood on  the ground, knowing nothing but mist and rain. He learned to ride the high  winds far inland, to dine there on delicate insects.  What he had once hoped for the Flock, he now gained for himself alone; he  learned to fly, and was not sorry for the price that he had paid. Jonathan  Seagull discovered that boredom and fear and anger are the reasons that a  gull\\'s life is so short, and with these gone from his thought, he lived a long  and fine life indeed.  They came in the evening, then, and found Jonathan gliding peaceful and  alone through his beloved sky. The two gulls that appeared at his wings were  pure as starlight, and the glow from them was gentle and friendly in the high  night air. But most lovely of all was the skill with which they flew, their  wingtips moving a precise and constant inch from his own.  Without a word, Jonathan put them to his test, a test that no gull had ever  passed. He twisted his wings, slowed to a single mile per hour above stall.  The two radiant birds slowed with him, smoothly, locked in position. They  knew about slow flying.  He folded his wings, rolled, and dropped in a dive to a hundred nd ninety  miles per hour. They dropped with him, streaking down in flawless  formation.  At last he turned that speed straight up into a long vertical slow-roll. The  rolled with him, smiling.  He recovered to level flight and was quiet for a time before he spoke.  \\\\\"Very well, \\\\\" he said, \\\\\"who are you?\\\\\"  \\\\\"We\\'re from your Flock, Jonathan. We are your brothers. \\\\\" The words were  strong and calm. \\\\\"We\\'ve come to take you higher, to take you home. \\\\\"  \\\\\"Home I have none. Flock I have none.

It was hardly  respectful to analyse heaven in the very moment that one flies up to enter it.  As he came from Earth now, above the clouds and in close formation with  the two brilliant gulls, he saw that his own body was growing as bright as  theirs. True, the same young Jonathan Seagull was there that has always lived  behind his golden eyes, but the outer form had changed.  It felt like a seagull body, but already it flew far better than his old one had  ever flown. Why, with half the effort, he though, I\\'ll get twice the speed,  twice the performance of my best days on earth!  His feathers glowed brilliant white now, and his wings were smooth and  perfect as sheets of polished silver. He began, delightedly, to learn about  them, to press power into these new wings.  At two hundred fifty miles per hour he felt that he was nearing his level-  flight maximum speed. At two hundred seventy-three he thought that he was  flying as fast as he could fly, and he was ever so faintly disappointed. There  was a limit to how much the new body could do, and though it was much  faster than his old level-flight record, it was still a limit that would take great  effort to crack. In heaven, he though, there should be no limits.  The clouds broke apart, his escorts called, \\\\\"Happy landings, Jonathan, \\\\\"  and vanished into thin air.  He was flying over a sea, toward a jagged shoreline. A very few seagulls  were working the updraughts on the cliffs. Away off to the north, at the  horizon itself, flew a few others. New sights, new thoughts, new questions.  Why so few gulls? Heaven should be, flocked with gulls! And why am I so  tired, all at once? Gulls in heaven are never supposed to be tired, or to sleep. \", \"Jonathan Seagull flies from Earth to heaven. He sees that his body has changed. His feathers glowed brilliant white now, and his wings are smooth and  perfect as sheets of polished silver.\"], [\"Where had he heard that? The memory of his life on Earth was falling  away. Earth had been a place where he had learned much, of course, but the  details were blurred - something about fighting for food, and being Outcast.  The dozen gulls by the shoreline came to meet him, none saying a word.  He felt only that he was welcome and that this was home. It had been a big  day for him, a day whose sunrise he no longer remembered.  He turned to land on the beach, beating his wings to stop an inch in the air,  then dropping lightly to the sand. The other gulls landed too, but not one of  them so much as flapped a feather, they swung into the wind, bright wings  outstretched, then somehow they changed the curve of their feathers until  they had stopped in the same instant their feet touched the ground. It was  beautiful control, but now Jonathan was just too tired to try it. Standing there  on the beach still without a word spoken, he was asleep.  In the days that followed, Jonathan saw that there was as much to learn  about flight in this place as there had been in the life behind him. But with a  difference. Here were gulls who thought as he thought. For each of them, the  most important thing in living was to reach out and touch perfection in that  which they most loved to do, and that was to fly. They were magnificent  birds, all of them, and they spent hour after hour every day practicing flight,  testing advanced aeronautics.  For a long time Jonathan forgot about the world that he had come from,  that place where the Flock lived with its eyes tightly shut to the joy of flight,  using its wings as means to the end of finding and fighting for food. But now  and then, just for a moment, he remembered.  He remembered it one morning when he was out with his instructor, while  they rested on the beach after a session of folded- wing snap rolls.  \\\\\"Where is everybody , Sullivan?\\\\\" He asked silently, quite at home now with  the easy telepathy that these gulls used instead of screes and gracks. \\\\\"Why  aren\\'t there more of us here? Why, where I came from there were... \\\\\"  \\\\\"... thousands and thousands of gulls. I know. \\\\\" Sullivan shook his head.  \\\\\"The only answer I can see, Jonathan, is that you are pretty well a one-in-a-  million bird. Most of us came along ever so slowly, we went from one world  into another that was almost exactly like it, forgetting right away where we  had come from, not caring where we were headed, living for the moment. Do  you have any idea how many lives we must have gone though before we even  got the first idea that there is more to life than eating, or fighting, or power in  the Flock? A thousand lives, Jon, ten thousand! And then another hundred  lives until we began to learn that there is such a thing as perfection, and  another hundred again to get the idea that our purpose for living is to find  that perfection and show it forth. The same rule holds for us now, of course;  we choose our next world through what we learn in this one. Learn nothing,  and the next world is the same as this one, all the same limitations and lead  weights to overcome. \\\\\"  he stretched his wings and turned to face the wind. \\\\\"But you, Jon. \\\\\" he said,  \\\\\"learned so much at one time that you don 7 have to go through a thousand  lives to reach this one. \\\\\"  In moment they were airborne again, practicing. The formation point-rolls  were difficult, for through the inverted half Jonathan had to think upside  down, reversing the curve of his wing and reversing it exactly in harmony  with his instructor\\'s.  \\\\\"Let\\'s try it again, \\\\\" Sullivan said, over and over: \\\\\"Let\\'s try it again. \\\\\" Then,  finally, \\\\\"Good. \\\\\" And they began practicing outside loops. \", \"Jonathan\\'s life on Earth had been a place where he had learned much, of course, but the details were blurred. The dozen gulls by the shoreline came to meet him, none saying a word. He felt only that he was welcome and that this was home.\"], [\"One evening the gulls that were not nightly-flying stood together on the  sand, thinking. Jonathon took all his courage in his head and walked to the  Elder Gull, who, it was said, was soon to be moving beyond this world.  \\\\\"Chiang... \\\\\" he said, a little nervously.  The old seagull looked at him kindly. \\\\\"Yes,, my son?\\\\\" Instead of being  enfeebled by age, the Elder had been empowered by it; he could outfly any  gull in the Flock, and he had learned skills that the others were only gradually  coming to know.  \\\\\"Chiang, this world isn\\'t heaven at all, is it?\\\\\"  The Elder smiled in the moonlight. \\\\\"You are learning again, Jonathan  Seagull, \\\\\" he said.  Well, what happens from here? Where are we going? Is there no such  place as heaven?\\\\\"  \\\\\"No, Jonathan, there is no such place. Heaven is not a place, and it is not a  time. Heaven is being perfect. \\\\\" He was silent for a moment. \\\\\"You are a very  fast flier, aren \\'t you ? \\\\\" \", \"\\\\\"This world isn\\'t heaven at all, is it?\\\\\" \\\\\"No, Jonathan, there is no such place.

And that isn\\'t flying a thousand miles an hour, or a million, or  flying at the speed of light. Because any number is a limit, and perfection  doesn\\'t have limits. Perfect speed, my son, is being there. \\\\\"  Without warning, Chiang vanished and appeared at the waters edge fifty  feet away, all in the flicker of an instant. Then he vanished again and stood,  in the same millisecond, at Jonathan\\'s shoulder. \\\\\"It\\'s kind of fun, \\\\\" he said.  Jonathan was dazzled. He forgot to ask about heaven. \\\\\"How do you do  that? What does it feel like? How far can you go?\\\\\"  \\\\\"You can go to any place and to any time that you wish to go, \\\\\" the Elder  said. \\\\\"I\\'ve gone everywhere and everywhen I can think of. \\\\\" He looked across  the sea. \\\\\"It\\'s strange. The gulls who scorn perfection for the sake of travel go  nowhere, slowly. Those who put aside travel for the sake of perfection go  anywhere, instantly. Remember, Jonathan, heaven isn \\'t a place or a time  because place and time are so very meaningless. Heaven is... \\\\\"  \\\\\"Can you teach me to fly like that?\\\\\" Jonathan Seagull trembled to conquer  another unknown.  \\\\\"Of course, if you wish to learn.\\\\\"  \\\\\"I wish. When can we start?\\\\u201d  \\\\\"We could start now, if you\\'d like. \\\\\"  \\\\\"I want to learn to fly like that, \\\\\" Jonathan said, and a strange light glowed  in his eyes. \\\\\"Tell me what to do. \\\\\"  Chiang spoke slowly and watched the younger gull ever so carefully. \\\\\"To  fly as fast as thought, to anywhere that is, \\\\\" he said, \\\\\"you must begin by  knowing that you have already arrived... \\\\\"  The trick, according to Chiang, was for Jonathan to stop seeing himself as  trapped inside a limited body that had a forty-two-inch wingspan and  performance that could be plotted on a chart. The trick was to know that his  true nature lived, as perfect as an unwritten number, everywhere at once  across space and time. \", \"Jonathan Seagull asks Chiang to teach him how to fly.

This is just the same. Now try  again... \\\\\"  Then one day Jonathan, standing on the shore, cloising his eyes,  concentrating, all in a flash knew what chiang had been telling him. \\\\\"Why,  that\\'s true! lam a perfect, unlimited gull!\\\\\" He felt a great shock of joy.  \\\\\"Good!\\\\\" sad Chiang, and there was victory in his voice.  Jonathan opened his eyes. He stood alone with the Elder on a totally  different seashore - trees down to the water\\'s edge, twin yellow suns turning  overhead.  \\\\\"At last you\\'ve got the idea, \\\\\" Chiang said, \\\\\"but your control needs a little  work... \\\\\"  Jonathan was stunned. \\\\\"Where are we?\\\\\"  Utterly unimpressed with the strange surroundings, the Elder brushed the  question aside. \\\\\"We\\'re on some planet, obviously, with a green sky and a  double star for a sun. \\\\\"  Jonathan made a scree of delight, the first sound he had made since he had  left Earth. \\\\\"IT WORKS! \\\\\"  \\\\\"Well, of course it works, Jon. \\\\\" said Chaing. \\\\\"It always works, when you  know what you\\'re doing.

He felt a great shock of joy.\"], [\"By the time they returned, it was dark. The other gulls looked at Jonathan  with awe in their golden eyes, for they have seen him disappear from where  he had been rooted for so long.  He stood their congratulations for less than a minute, \\\\\"I\\'m the newcomer  here! I\\'m just beginning! It is I who must learn from you!\\\\\"  \\\\\"I wonder about that, Jon, \\\\\" said Sullivan, standing near. \\\\\"You have less  fear of learning than any gull I\\'ve seen in the thousand years. \\\\\" The Flock fell  silent, and Jonathan fidgeted in embarrassment.  \\\\\"We can start working with time if you wish, \\\\\" Chiang said, \\\\\"till you canffly  the past and the future.

He always had learned quickly from ordinary  experience, and now, the special student of the Elder Himself, he took in new  ideas like a streamlined feathered computer.  But then the day came that Chiang vanished. He had been talking quietly  with them all, exhorting them never to stop their learning and their practising  and their striving to understand more of the perfect invisible priciple of all  life. Then, as he spoke, his feathers went brighter and brighter and at last  turned so brilliant that no gull could look upon him.  \\\\\"Jonathan, \\\\\" he said, and these were the last words that he spoke, \\\\\"keep  working on love. \\\\\"  When they could see again, Chiang was gone.  As the days went past, Jonathan found himself thinking time and time  again of the Earth from which he had come. If he had known there just a  tenth, just a hundredth, of what he knew here, how much more life would  have meant! He stood on the sand and fell to wondering if there was a gull  back there who might be struggling to break out of his limits, to see the  meaning of flight beyond a way of travel to get a breadcrumb from a rowboat.  Perhaps there might even have been one made Outcast for speaking his truth  in the face of the Flock. And the more Jonathan practised his kindness  lessons, and the more he worked to know the nature of love, the more he  wanted to go back to Earth. For in spite of his lonely past, Jonathan Seagull  was born to be an instructor, and his own way of demonstrating love was to  give something of the truth that he had seen to a gull who asked only a  chance to see truth for himself.  Sullivan, adept now at thought-speed flight and helping the others to learn,  was doubtful.  \\\\\"Jon, you were Outcast once. Why do you think that any of the gulls in  your old time would listen to you now? You know the proverb, and it\\'s true:  The gull sees farthest who flies highest. Those gulls where you came from are  standing on the ground, squaking and fighting among themselves. They\\'re a  thousand miles from heaven - and you say you want to show them heaven  from where they stand! Jon, they can\\'t see their own wingtips! Stay here.  Help the new gulls here, the ones who are high enough to see what you have  to tell them. \\\\\" He was quiet for a moment, and then he said, \\\\\"What if Chiang  had gone back to his old worlds? Where would you have been today?\\\\\"  The last point was the telling one, and Sullivan was right. The gull ses  farthest who flies highest. \", \"A month went by, or something that felt about like a month, and Jonathan  learned at the tremendous rate. But then the day came that Chiang vanished.

How much more would he have known by  now if Chaing had come to him on the day that he was Outcast!  \\\\\"Sully, I must go back, \\\\\" he said at last. \\\\\"Your students are doing well. They  can help you bring the newcomers along. \\\\\"  Sullivan sighed, but he did not argue. \\\\\"I think I\\'ll miss you, Jonathan, \\\\\" was  all that he said.  \\\\\"Sully, for shame!\\\\\" Jonathan said in reproach, \\\\\"and don\\'t be foolish! What  are we trying to practise every day? If our friendship depends on things like  space and time, then when we finally overcome space and time, we\\'ve  destroyed our own brotherhood! But overcome space, and all we have left is  Here. Overcome time, and all we have left is Now. And in the middle of Here  and Now, don\\'t you think that we might see each other once or twice?\\\\\"  Sullivan Seagull laughed in spite of himself. \\\\\"You crazy bird, \\\\\" he said  kindly. \\\\\"If anybody can show someone on the ground how to see a thousand  miles, it will be Jonathan Livingston Seagull.: He looked at the sand. \\\\\"Good-  bye, Jon, my friend. \\\\\"  \\\\\"Good-bye, Sully. We\\'ll meet again. \\\\\" And with that, Jonathan held in  thought an image of the great gull-flocks on the shore of another time, and he  knew with practiced ease that he was not bone and feather but a perfect idea  of freedom and fight, limited by nothing at all.  Fletcher Lynd Seagull was still quite young, but already he knew that no  bird had ever been so harshly treated by any Flock, or with so much injustice.  \\\\\"I don \\'t care what they say, \\\\\" he thought fiercely , and his vision blured as  he flew out toward the Far Cliffs. \\\\\"There\\'s so much more to flying than just  flapping around from place to place! A a....mnosquito does that! One little  barrel-roll around the Elder Gull, just for fun, and I\\'m Outcast! Are they  blind? Can \\'t they see? Can \\'t they think of the glory that it\\'ll be when we really  learn to fly?  \\\\\"I don\\'t care what they think. I\\'ll show them what flying is! I\\'ll be pure  Outlaw, if that\\'s the way they want it.

Forgive them, and help them to understand. \\\\\"  An inch from his right wingtip flew the most brilliant white gull in all the  world, gliding effortlessly along, not moving a feather, at what was very  nearly Fletcher\\'s top speed.  There was a moment of chaos in the young bird.  \\\\\"What\\'s going on? Am I mad? Am I dead? What is this?\\\\\"  Low and calm, the voice went on within his thought, demanding an  answer. \\\\\"Fletcher Lynd Seagull, do you want to fly?\\\\\"  \\\\\"YES, I WANT TO FLY!\\\\\"  \\\\\"Fletcher Lynd Seagull, do you want to fly so much that you will forgive  the Flock, and learn, and go back to them one day and work to help them  know?\\\\\"  There was no lying to this magnificent skilful being, no matter how proud  or how hurt a bird was Fletcher Seagull.  \\\\\"I do, \\\\\" he said softly.  \\\\\"Then, Fletch, \\\\\" that bright creature said to him, and the voice was very  kind, \\\\\"Let\\'s begin with Level Flight... \\\\\" \", \"\\\\\"Fletcher Lynd Seagull, do you want to fly?\\\\\" \\\\\"YES, I WANT TO FLY!\\\\\" \\\\\"Then, Fletch, \\\\\" that bright creature said to him, and the voice was very kind, \\\\\"Let\\'s begin with Level Flight... \\\\\"\"]], \"PART THREE\": [[\"Jonathan circled slowly over the Far Cliffs, watching.

Still, it was easier for them to practice high performance than it was to  understand the reason behind it.  \\\\\"Each of us is in truth an idea of the Great Gull, and unlimited idea of  freedom, \\\\\" Jonathan would stay in the evenings on the beach, \\\\\"and precision  flying is a step toward expressing our real nature. Everything that limits us  where we have to put aside. That\\'s why all this high-speed practice, and low-  speed and aerobatics... \\\\\"  ...and his students would be asleep, exhausted from the day\\'s flying. They  liked the practice, because it was fast and exciting and it fed a hunger for  learning that grew with every lesson. But not one of them, not even Fletcher  Lynd Gull, had come to believe that the flight of ideas could possibly be as  real as this flight of wind and feather.  \\\\\"Your whole body, from wingtip to wingtip, \\\\\" Jonathan would say, other  times, \\\\\"is nothing more than your thought itself, in a form you can see. Break  the chains of your thought, and you break the chains of your body, too ...\\\\\"  But no matter how he said it, it sounded like pleasant fiction, and they needed  more to sleep.  It was only a month later that Jonathan said the time had come to return to  the Flock. \", \"The Great Gulls are a group of Outcasts who live in the wilds of northern New England.

There was a brief anguish among his students, for it is the Law of the Flock  that an Outcast never returns, and the Law had not been broken once in ten  thousand years. The Law said stay; Jonathan said go; and by now he was a  mile across the water. If they waited much longer, he would reach a hostile  Flock alone.  \\\\\"Well, we don\\'t have to obey the law if we\\'re not apart of the Flock, do  we?\\\\\" Fletcher said, rather self-conciously. \\\\\"Besides, if there\\'s a fight, we\\'ll be  a lot more help there than here. \\\\\"  And so they flew in from the west that morning, eight of them in a double-  diamond formation, wingtips almost overlapping. They came across the  Flock\\'s Council Beach at a hundred thirty-five miles per hour, Jonathan in the  lead, Fletcher smoothly at hi right wing, Henry Calvin strugling gamely at his  left. Then the whole formation rolled slowly to the right, as one bird ... level  ... to ... inverted ... to ... level, the wind whipping over them all.  The squawks and grockles of everyday life in the Flock were cut off as  though the formation were a giant knife, and eight thousand gull-eyes  watched, without a single blink. One by one, each of the eight birds pulled  sharply upward into a landing on the sand. Then as though this sort of thing  happened every day, Jonathan Seagull began his critique of the flight.  \\\\\"To begin with, \\\\\" he said with a wry smile, \\\\\"you were all a bit late on the  join-up ...\\\\u201d \", \"The Law of the Flock is that an Outcast never returns, and the Law had not been broken once in ten  thousand years.

The gull who speaks to an Outcast is himself Outcast. The gull  who looks upon an Outcast breaks the Law of the Flock.  Grey- feathered backs were turned upon Jonathan from that moment  onward, but he didn\\'t appear to notice.

You know nothing till you prove it! FLY!\\\\\"  So quiet little Martin William Seagull, startled to be caught under his  instructor\\'s fire, suprised himself and beacme a wizard of low speeds. In the  lightest breeze he could curve his feathers to lift himself without a single flap  of wing from sand to cloud and down again.  Likewise Charles-Roland Gull flew the Great Mountain Wind to twenty-  four thousand feet, came down blue from the cold thin air, amazed and  happy, determined to go still higher tommorow.  Fletcher Seagull, who loved aerobatics like no one else, conquered his  sixteen-point vertical slow roll and the next day topped it off with a triple  cartwheel, his feathers flashing white sunlight to a beach from which more  than one furtive eye watched.  Every hour Jonathan was there at the side of each of his students,  demonstrating, suggesting, pressuring, guiding. He flew with them through  night and cloud and storm, for the sport of it, while the Flock huddled  miserably on the ground.  When the flying was done, the students relaxed on the sand, and in time  they listened more closely to Jonathan. He had some crazy ideas that they  coudn\\'t understand, but then he had some good ones that they could.  Gradually, in the night, another circle formed around the circle of students  - a circle of curious gulls listening in the darkness for hours on end, not  wishing to see or be seen of one another, fading away before daybreak.  It was a month after the Return that the first gull of the Flock crossed the  line and asked to learn how to fly. In his asking, Terrence Lowell Gull  became a condemned bird, labelled Outcast; and the eighth of Jonathan\\'s  students.  The nedt night from the Flock kame Kirk Maynard Gull, wobbling across  the sand, draggin his left wing, to collapse at Jonathan\\'s feet. \\\\\"Help me, \\\\\" he  said very quietly, speaking in the way that the dying speak. \\\\\"I want to fly  more than anything else in the world ...\\\\\"  \\\\\"Come alonjg then, \\\\\" said Jonathan. \\\\\"Climb with me away from the ground,  and we\\'ll begin\\\\\"  You don 7 understand.

The Flock was roused from  sleep by his cry, as lous as he could scream it, from five hundred feet up; \\\\\"I  can fly! Listen! 1 CAN FLY! \\\\\"  By sunrise there were nearly a thousand birds standing outside the circle of  students, looking cusiously at Maynard. They don\\'t care whether they were  seen or not, and they listened, trying to understand Jonathan Seagull.  He spoke of very simple things - that it is right for a gull to fly, that  freedom is the very nature of his being, that whatever stands against that  freedom must be set aside, be it ritual or superstition or limitation in any  form.  \\\\\"Set aside, \\\\\" came a voice from the multitude, \\\\\"even if it be the Law of the  Flock?\\\\\"  \\\\\"The only true law is that which leads to freedom, \\\\\" Jonathan said. \\\\\"There is  no other. \\\\\"  \\\\\"How do you expect us to fly as you fly?\\\\u201d came another voice. \\\\\"You are  special and gifted and divine, above other birds. \\\\\"  \\\\\"Look at Fletcher! Lowell! Charles-Roland! Are they also special and  gifted and divine? No more than you are, no more than lam. The only  difference, the very only one, is that they have begun to understand what they  really are and have begun to practise it. \\\\\"  His students, save Fletcher, shifted uneasily. They hadn\\'t realised that this  was what they were doing.  the crowd grew larger every day, coming to question, to idolize, to scorn.  \\\\\"They are saying in the Flock that if you are not the Son of the Great Gull  Himself, \\\\\" Fletcher told Jonathan one morning after the Advanced Speed  Practice, \\\\\"then you are a thousand years ahead of your time. \", \"Kirk Maynard Gull is the son of the Great Gull. He teaches his flock how to fly. The Flock is roused from sleep by his cry: \\\\\"I  can fly!\\\\\"\"], [\"Jonathan sighed. The price of being misunderstood, he thought. They call  you devil or they call you god. \\\\\"What do you think, Fletch? Are we ahead of  our time?\\\\\"  A long silence. \\\\\"Well, this kind of flying has always been here to be  learned by anybody who wanted to discover it; that\\'s got nothing to do with  time. We\\'re ahead of the fashion, maybe. Ahead of the way that most gulls  fly.\\\\\" \", \"Jonathan sighed. The price of being misunderstood, he thought. They call  you devil or they call you god. \\\\\"What do you think, Fletch? Are we ahead of our time?\\\\\"\"], [\"\\\\\"That\\'s something, \\\\\" Jonathan said, rolling to glide inverted for a while.  \\\\\"That\\'s not half as bad as being ahead of our time. \\\\\"  It happened just a week later. Fletcher was demonstrating the elements of  high-speed flying to a class of new students. He had just pulled out of his  dive from seven thousand feet, a long grey streak firing a few inches above  the beach, when a young bird on its first flight glided directly into his path,  calling for its mother. With a tenth of a second to avoid the youngster,  Flectcher Lynd Seagull snapped hard to the left, at something over two  hundred miles per hour, into a cliff of solid granite.  It was, for him, as though the rock were a giant hard door into another  world. A burst of fear and shock and black as he hit, and then he was adrift in  a strange strange sky, forgetting, remembering, forgetting; afraid and sad and  sorry, terribly sorry.  The voice came to him as it had in the first day that he had met Jonathan  Livingston Seagull.  \\\\\"The trick, Fletcher, is that we are trying to overcome our limitations in  order, patiently. We don \\'t tackle flying through rock until a little later in the  programme. \\\\\"  \\\\\"Jonathan! \\\\\"  \\\\\"Also known as the Son of the Great Gull, \\\\\" his instructor said dryly.  \\\\\"What are you doing here? The cliff! Haven\\'t . 1 . . . didn\\'t 1 . . . die?\\\\\"  \\\\\"Oh, Fletch, come on. Think. If you are talking to me now, then obviously  you didn\\'t die, did you? What you did manage to do was to change your level  of consciousness rather abruptly. It\\'s your choice now. You can stay here and  learn on this level - which is quite a bit higher than the one you left, by the  way - or you can go back and keep working with the Flock. The Elders were  hoping for some kind of disaster, but they\\'re startled that you obliged them so  well. \", \"Flectcher Lynd Seagull crashed into a cliff at two hundred miles per hour. He was adrift in a strange strange sky, forgetting, remembering, forgetting; afraid and sad and  sorry.\"], [\"\\\\\"I want to go back to the Flock, of course. I\\'ve barely begun with the new  group! \\\\\"  \\\\\"Very well, Fletcher. Remember what we were saying about one\\'s body  being nothing more than thought itself . . . ?\\\\\"  Fletcher shook his head and stretched his wings and opened his eyes at the  base of the cliff, in the centre of the whole Flock assembled. There was a  great clamour of sqawks and screes from the crowd when first he moved.  \\\\\"He lives! He that was dead lives!\\\\\"  \\\\\"Touched him with a wingtip! Brought him to life! The Son of the Great  Gull!\\\\\"  \\\\\"NO! He denies it! He\\'s a devil! DEVIL! Come to break the Flock!\\\\\"  There wre four thousand gulls in the crowd, frightened at what had  happened, and the cry DEVIL! went through them like the wind of an ocean  storm. Eyes glazed, beaks sharp, they closed in to destroy.  \\\\\"Would you feel better if we left, Fletcher?\\\\\" asked Jonathan.  \\\\\"I certainly wouldn\\'t object too much if we did ...\\\\\"  Instantly they stood togeher a half-mile away, and the flashing breaks of  the mob closed on empty air.  \\\\\"Why is it, \\\\\" Jonathan puzzled, \\\\\"that the hardest thing in the world is to  convince a bird that he is free, and that he can prove it for himself if he\\'d just  spend a little time practising? Why should that be so hard?\\\\\"  Fletcher still blinked from the change of scene. \\\\\"What did you just do?  How did we get here?\\\\\"  \\\\\"You did say you wanted to be out of the mob, didn\\'t you?\\\\\"  Yes! But how did you ...\\\\\"  \\\\\"Like everything else, Fletcher. Practice\\\\\"  By morning the Flock had forgotten its insanity, but Fletcher had not.  \\\\\"Jonathan, remember what you said a long time ago, about loving the Flock  enough to return to it and help it learn?\\\\\"  \\\\\"Yes!\\\\\"  \\\\\"I don\\'t understand how you manage to love a mob of birds that has just  tried to kill you. \\\\\"  \\\\\"Oh, Fletch, you don\\'t love that! You don\\'t love hatred and evil, of course.  You have to practise and see the real gull, the good in everyone of them, and  to help them see it in themselves. That\\'s what I mean by love. It\\'s fun, when  you get the knack of it.  \\\\\"I remember a fierce young bird, for instance, Fletcher Lynd Seagull, his  name. Just been made Outcast, ready to fight the Flock to the death, getting a  start on building his own bitter hell out on the Far Cliffs. And here he is  today building his own heaven instead, and leading the whole Flock in that  direction. \\\\\"  Fletcher turned to his instructor, and there was a moment of fright in his  eye. \\\\\"Me leading? What do you mean, me leading? You\\'re the instructor  here. You couldn 7 leave! \\\\\"  \\\\\"Couldn\\'t I? Don\\'t you think that there might be other flocks, other  Fletchers, that need an instructor more than this one, that\\'s on its way toward  the light?\\\\\"  \\\\\"Me ? Jon, I\\'m just a plain seagull, and you \\'re .. . \\\\\"  \\\\\". . . the only Son of the Great Gull, I suppose?\\\\\" Johnathan sighed and  looked out to sea. \\\\\"You don\\'t need me any longer.. You need to keep finding  yourself, a little more each day, that real, unlimited Fletcher Seagull, he\\'s  your instructor. You need to understand him and to practice him. \\\\\"  A moment later Jonathan\\'s body wavered in the air, shimmering, and began  to go transparent. \\\\\"Don\\'t let them spread silly rumours about me, or make me  a god. O.K., Fletch? I\\'m a seagull, I like to fly, maybe ...\\\\u201d  \\\\\"JONATHAN!\\\\\"  \\\\\"Poor Fletch. Don\\'t believe what your eyes are telling you. All they show is  limitation. Look with your understanding, find out waht you already know,  andyou;ll see the way to fly. \\\\\"  The shimmering stopped. Jonathan Seagull had vanished into empty air.  After a time, Fletcher Gull dragged himself into the sky and faced a brand-  new group of students, eager for their first lesson. \", \"Fletch was attacked by a mob of four thousand gulls. They tried to kill him, but he managed to escape. He returned to the Flock to tell them what had happened.\"], [\"\\\\\"To begin with, \\\\\" he said heavily, \\\\\"you\\'ve got to understand that a seagull is  an unlimited idea of freedom, an image of the Great Gull, and your whole  body, from wingtip to wingtip, is nothing more than your though itself. \\\\\"  The young gulls looked at him quizzically. Come on, they thought, this  doesn\\'t sound like a rule for a loop.  Fletcher sighed and started over. \\\\\"Hm. Ah . . very well, \\\\\" he said, and eyed  them critically. \\\\\"Let\\'s begin with Level Flight. \\\\\" And saying that, he  understood all at once that his friend had quite honestly been no more divine  than Fletcher himself.  No limits, Jonathan? he thought. Well, then, the time\\'s not distant when I\\'m  going to appear out of thin air on your beach, and show you a thing or two  about flying!  And though he tried to look properly severe for his students, Fletcher  Seagull suddenly saw them all as they really were, just for a moment, and he  more than liked, he loved what it was he saw. No limits, Jonathan? he though,  and he smiled. His race to learn had begun. \", \"A seagull is an unlimited idea of freedom, an image of the Great Gull, and your whole  body, from wingtip to wingtip, is nothing more than your though itself.
